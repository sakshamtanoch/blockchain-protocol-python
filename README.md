# blockchain-protocol-python
Its a blockchain protocol which I tried to to build from the ground, following along a book. I couldn't complete the project because there was so much to learn about in this space, used to get stuck again and again and finally I stopped. So till now this blockchain can add new blocks, confirm a transaction, prevents manipulation and gives several options to make it easier to work with it.
May I would return back and continue working on it for which am unsure about..
